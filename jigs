View on GitHub
Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

This is a wordpress plugin to help you create animated shortcodes buttons and content builder sections for your website/blog. You can visit my blog at vashishthakapoor.com to see the live preview of the same.

It does wonders to make your website much better and look attractive by the use of hover.css, animate.css and wow.js.

Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

The code works something like that
'
<a href="#">Start Now</a>
<a href="http://www.bloggersideas.com/top-web-hosting-services/
">Top Best webhosting services</a>
'
will be changed to 
' <a href="#" class="button-red hvr-shrink wow bounce">Start Now</a> '

And adding css class to an element, I could make it much eye-catching and beautiful. Specially for WordPress.

It uses

- animate.css
- hover.css

and 
<a href="http://www.bloggersideas.com/best-affiliate-programs/

">best affiliate programs</a>

- wow.js

This is what being done on my live website and you can easily have a look at it.

Coming up in the plugin

1. Shortcode Awesomeness
2. Use of wow.js
3. Use of Animate.css
4. Use of hover.css

I am also planning to use scrollmagic.js in this project. You can also contribute to this project. 

Thank you
